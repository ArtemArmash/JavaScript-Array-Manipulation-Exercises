# JavaScript Array Manipulation Exercises

This repository contains a collection of five self-contained scripts in a single `app.js` file, each demonstrating a different fundamental or modern technique for working with arrays in JavaScript. The project is designed to be run directly in a web browser's developer console.

## About The Project

This is an educational project perfect for beginners and intermediate developers looking to practice their JavaScript array skills. The scripts cover everything from basic array modification and looping to more advanced concepts like higher-order functions and the spread syntax.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   **Array Creation and Modification**: How to create an array and change an element at a specific index.
*   **Array Iteration**: Using both traditional `for` loops and the modern `for...of` loop to iterate over array elements.
*   **Data Aggregation**: Calculating the sum of all elements in an array.
*   **Built-in Math Functions**: Using `Math.max` combined with the **spread syntax (`...`)** to efficiently find the largest value in an array.
*   **Higher-Order Functions**: Using the `.filter()` method to create a new array based on a condition.
*   **Arrow Functions**: Writing concise, single-line logic for the `.filter()` method.

## Included Scripts

The `app.js` file contains the following five sequential scripts:

1.  **Array Modification**: Creates an array and demonstrates how to modify an element by its index.
2.  **Sum of Array Elements**: Initializes an array of numbers and calculates their total sum using a `for` loop.
3.  **Simple Iteration with `for...of`**: Prints each number in an array from 1 to 10 to the console, showcasing a modern iteration method.
4.  **Find Maximum Value**: Finds and displays the largest number in an array using `Math.max` and the spread syntax.
5.  **Filter Array by String Length**: Creates a new array containing only the strings from an original array that have a length greater than seven.

## How to Run the Project

This project runs entirely in your web browser; there is no visible content on the webpage itself.

1.  **Download the Files**:
    *   Clone or download the repository containing `index.html` and `app.js`.

2.  **Open the HTML File**:
    *   Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
    *   The page will appear blank. This is the correct behavior.

3.  **Open the Developer Console**:
    *   Press the `F12` key on your keyboard.
    *   Alternatively, right-click on the blank page, select "Inspect", and navigate to the **"Console"** tab.

4.  **View the Results**:
    *   The results from all five scripts will be automatically printed to the developer console when the page loads.

## Screenshot of Console Output

Here is an example of what the output looks like in the developer console after the script runs:
